### Project Description
The term Vaazha has become a popular synonym for a useless person. Everyone will have been called a Vaazha at least once in their lifetime.
We found a way to measure how much of a VAAZHA you actually are!!
Just input your age and your favourite Banana variety.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
How to measure how much of a VAAZHA you actually are?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Input your Vaazha's(can be your friend or yourself but most probably that one friend you just thought of) age and your favourite banana variety. We can calculate the profit his/her parents would have received if they actually planted a vaazha( the real banana plant) instead of..you know

For Software:The Vaazha-O-Meter is an interactive web app that calculates and visualizes banana farming profits, life expenses over a specified number of years, and potential investment returns if those expenses were invested in banana farming. Users select a banana variety and input the number of years, after which the app dynamically generates detailed profit and expense summaries accompanied by bar, line, and pie charts powered by Chart.js.
